# Some examples for students at the University of Colorado [wait for it...] Colorado Springs (UCCS); The best students "EV [wait for it...] ER".

This just a [foray](https://www.google.com/search?q=foray&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS814US814&oq=foray&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1250j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) into using GitHub as a lecture repository... more to come.

We all know I need to organize my code... no more waiting for me to find examples during a lecture.

Check out the ``.ipynb`` files for specific lectures.  Copy or clone the ``.py`` files for serious work :)

It's just scraps.
