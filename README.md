Let me turn the `m` upside-down and write `w` instead, because in Machine Learning we talk about `weights` (w) and biases (b) so we have :

\begin{equation}
    y = w*x + b
\end{equation}

Note that this function is a specific case 
of a linear function:

\begin{equation}
y = (w_n*x_n) + (w_{n-1}*x_{n-1}) + \dots + w_{0}*x_{0} + b
\end{equation}
